# DNSMASQ DHCP/DNS Configuration Testing (Day 2)

<!-- more -->

---

## Work Completed

On this date, the following was completed:

- Verified that the latest XML configurations for DNSMASQ DHCP were working
  - Verified that test devices in the FAMILY/GUEST enviroment were able to do the following:
    - Receive an IP from the corresponding DHCP scope
    - Gain Internet access (by 8.8.8.8 and google.com)
    - Gain access to each other by FQDN and be able to perform appropriate DNS forward/reverse lookups
      (both within the same subnet and outside of it)
- Added logic to disable the original ISC DHCP implementation for the LAN interface
- Re-worked the functionality so that the LAN and LOOPBACK interfaces were excluded for DHCP use by DNSMASQ 
(as we aren't creating scopes for them)
- Re-organized project files to break up task files into three subfolders:
    - Initial Prep (What needs to be done before re-configuring the XML?)
    - XML Configs (what changes need to be made?)
    - Post Config Actions (what actions we might need to take after the fact?)

## Current Status / Next Steps:

Going forward, I will be doing the following:

- Looking into whether it would be necessary to modify the DNSMASQ DHCP/DNS configuration (for the TOOLS4EVER network) to use **tools4ever.firstgambrellianempire.com** rather than **tools4ever.internal.firstgambrellianempire.com** for consistency with the existing AD domain in use.
