# DNSMASQ DHCP/DNS Configuration Buildout

<!-- more -->

---

## Work Completed

On this date, the following was completed:

- Built out tasks for XML configuration for DNSMASQ itself and the DHCP scopes that would be needed

---

## Current Status / Next Steps:

Going forward, I will be doing the following:

- Applying that configuration to the test firewall instance in GNS3 and verifying afterward that
  traffic flow is working correctly for DNS/DHCP. 
    - A Mikrotik switch will be re-configured from scratch in GNS3 to practice my skills in configuring them
      and it will be used in tandem for testing the configuration.
