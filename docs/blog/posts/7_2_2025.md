# DNSMASQ DHCP/DNS Configuration Testing (Day 1)

<!-- more -->

---

## Work Completed

On this date, the following was completed:

- Worked through some syntax/logic errors for the DNSMASQ DHCP/DNS logic while
  running the project in changed/production mode to make the desired XML changes.
- Started looking into the configuration of RouterOS for vlan use for configuration testing.

---

## Current Status / Next Steps:

Going forward, I will be doing the following:

- Continuing to test the configuration to the test firewall instance in GNS3 and verifying afterward that
  traffic flow is working correctly for DNS/DHCP.
    - Start working to configure a Mikrotik instance for testing as well (to replicate a similar RoAS configuration
    that will later be used in production)
