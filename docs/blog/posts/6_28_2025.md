# Unbound DNS Query Forwarding Buildout/Project Re-structuring

<!-- more -->

---

## Work Completed

On this date, the following was completed:

- Built out tasks for XML configuration for Unbound DNS and for the query forwarding that needs to be 
  setup for each internal network
- Re-structured the project to remove the "FIREWALL - " and "CONTROL NODE - " naming scheme for tasks and utilized
  variable overrides to detail all relevant information for internal network configurations instead. 
  The following example might be used:
    
  **INTERNAL NETWORK - [NETWORK NAME] - CREATE VLAN [VLAN ID] - SET [VLAN OPTION] - [VLAN OPTION VALUE]**

## Current Status / Next Steps:

Going forward, I will be doing the following:

- Working to build the DNSMASQ DHCP/DNS XML task configurations and testing those once they're built out.
