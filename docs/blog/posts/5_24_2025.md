# VLAN Configurations

<!-- more -->

---

## Work Completed

**Note: This is the first entry for the project.**

On this date, the following was completed:

- Finished configuration of OPNSense XML handling so that all internal VLANs could be created.
- Consolidated config file manipulation functionality into a single tasks file and ensured that
the playbook could successfully exit execution if the pulled file was out of date.
- Migrated the variable for the local config file directory from the inventory host file to the playbook itself (didn't make sense to have it in the configuration of the managed firewall).

## Current Status / Next Steps:

Going forward, I will be doing the following:

- Working on modifying the VLANs task folder so that we can generate the L3 config, interface assignment, DHCP, and DNS configurations for each of them
in one go (rather than breaking them up and iterating over each vlan several times).
